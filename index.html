    <p id="tribute-info">On Thursday 6th May 1952, Rodger Bannister was the first man to run a mile in under 4 minutes. Today this is an expectation for athletes, but in 1952 it was considered by medical experts that it was impossible for the human body to run a sub 4 minute mile. Rodger had to look beyond the medical expertise of his time, and be willing to adapt his training differently to the advice of his time. </p>
